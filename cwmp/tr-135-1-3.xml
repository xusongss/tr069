Most of the parameters in this object are comma-separated lists of individual statistics values, each of which corresponds to a sample interval.

Each comma-separated list can contain up to {{param|##.ReportSamples}} statistics values.  When the list is full, each new value causes the oldest one to be discarded.
Some comma-separated lists contain terms that are comma-separated lists themselves and are used to store measurements on an event basis. These sub-lists can contain up to {{param|.Capabilities.ServiceMonitoring.MaxEventsPerSampleInterval}} values.
